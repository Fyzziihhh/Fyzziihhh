# üí´ About Me:
My name is Faizal, and I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong background in web development. I recently completed my high school studies at Pattom St. Mary's with a focus on Commerce and decided to dive deeper into the world of technology. I specialize in using technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I'm currently honing my skills in TypeScript and Redux.<br><br>Over the past few months, I've been dedicated to developing my own e-commerce projects, including a skincare website named "PentaLuxe" and a perfume e-commerce site. These projects have given me hands-on experience with a range of tools and concepts, from designing user interfaces in Figma to implementing dynamic features in React.<br><br>I believe in turning challenges into learning opportunities and am always eager to explore new technologies and improve my skills. I also value clear and effective communication, which I believe is key to successful collaboration in any project.<br><br>Thank you for your time, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you!
